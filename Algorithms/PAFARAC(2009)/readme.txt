---------------- pack adaptive_parafac --------------------
This package is a demo to illustrate the behavior of the adaptive PARAFAC 
algorithms (parafac-sdt and parafac-rlst) proposed in

D. Nion and N. D. Sidiropoulos, "Adaptive Algorithms to Track the PARAFAC Decomposition of a 
Third-Order Tensor", IEEE. Trans. on Signal Processing, vol. 57, no. 6, June 2009.
